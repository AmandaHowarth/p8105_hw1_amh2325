## Creating a dataframe 

This data frame will include classes in a high school and the floor they are located on within the school 

```{r}

#create a dataframe 
set.seed(8)
HW_df = tibble(
    samp = rnorm(8),
classes = samp > 0,
class = c("biology", "chemistry", "physics", "history", "math", "art", "music", "gym"),
floor = factor(c("first", "second", "third", "second", "first", "second", "third", "first"))
)

```

Taking the mean of each variable
```{r}
mean(pull(HW_df, samp))

```
