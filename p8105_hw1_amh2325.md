## Problem 1:

This problem is intended to emphasize variable types and introduce
coercion; some awareness of how R treats numeric, character, and factor
variables is necessary for working with these data types in practice.

## Creating a dataframe

This data frame will include classes in a high school and the floor they
are located on within the school

``` r
#create a dataframe 
set.seed(8)
hw_df = tibble(
    samp = rnorm(8),
    logic = samp > 0,
    class = c("biology", "chemistry", "physics", "history", "math", "art", "music", "gym"),
    floor = factor(c("first", "second", "third", "second", "first", "second", "third", "first"))
)
```

Taking the mean of each variable

``` r
#taking mean values for each variable in hw_df 
mean(pull(hw_df, samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.1111207

``` r
mean(pull(hw_df, logic))
```

    ## [1] 0.25

``` r
mean(pull(hw_df, class))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw_df, class)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(hw_df, floor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw_df, floor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We received the mean for the numeric (samp) and logical (logic)
variables. For both the charcter (class) and factor (floor) variables, R
would not allow us to get the mean. We receive the following warning:
argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\[1\] NA. According to
r, This is because “there are currently methods for numeric/logical
vectors and date, date-time, and time interval objects. Complex vectors
are allowed for trim=0.” A mean cannot be obtained for the character and
factor variables since they are technically not numeric.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw_df,logic))
```

    ## [1] 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw_df,class))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw_df,floor))
```

    ## [1] 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 1

When we run the above codes, the values are outputted for the “logic”
and “floor” variable but not for the “class” variable. This is because
the logical variable, “logic,” has a value of 0 (false) and 1(true).
When the factor variable (categorical ordinal) was converted into
numeric, the “floor” variable was assigned numbers according to its
order: 1=first, 2=second, 3=third. However, the “class” variable
(categorical nominal) would still not produce a mean because it cannot
be converted to a numeric variable. This example explains why a mean can
only be produced for variables that are numeric or logical.

Converting logical variables

``` r
#converting logical vector to numeric and multiplying by samp
logic = as.numeric(pull(hw_df, logic))
pull(hw_df, samp)*logic 
```

    ## [1] 0.0000000 0.8404001 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.7360404 0.0000000 0.0000000
    ## [8] 0.0000000

``` r
#converting logical vector to a factor and then multiplying by samp
logic = as.factor(pull(hw_df, logic))
pull(hw_df, samp)*logic
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(pull(hw_df, samp), logic): '*' not meaningful for
    ## factors

    ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
#converting logical vector to a factor, then converting the result to numeric, and multiplying by samp
as.factor(pull(hw_df, logic))
```

    ## [1] FALSE TRUE  FALSE FALSE TRUE  FALSE FALSE FALSE
    ## Levels: FALSE TRUE

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(pull(hw_df, logic)))*pull(hw_df, samp)
```

    ## [1] -0.08458607  1.68080025 -0.46348277 -0.55083500  1.47208086 -0.10788140
    ## [7] -0.17028915 -1.08833171

## Problem 2:

This problem focuses the use of inline R code, plotting, and the
behavior of ggplot for variables of different types.

``` r
#creating a dataframe for Problem 2
set.seed(1000)
hw2_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500),
  y = rnorm(500),
  logical_vector = c((x + y) > 1),
  numeric_vector = as.numeric(logical_vector),
  factor_vector = as.factor(logical_vector)
  )
```

``` r
#rows and columns in hw2_df 
  nrow(hw2_df)
```

    ## [1] 500

``` r
  ncol(hw2_df)
```

    ## [1] 5

``` r
#mean, median, and standard deviation of x 
mean(pull(hw2_df, x))
```

    ## [1] 0.008544891

``` r
median(pull(hw2_df, x))
```

    ## [1] 0.006517422

``` r
sd(pull(hw2_df, x))
```

    ## [1] 0.9390666

``` r
#the proportion of cases for which x+y>1 
mean(pull(hw2_df, logical_vector))
```

    ## [1] 0.236

``` r
#In my vector, there are 500 rows in the dataset and five columns. The mean value of x is 0.008544891, and the median value of x is 0.006517422. The standard deviation of x is 0.9390666. The proportion of cases for which x + y > 1 is 0.236.
```

## Making a scatterplot

``` r
#plot 1 with logical_vector 
plot1 <- ggplot(hw2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = logical_vector)) + geom_point()

ggsave ("plotdata.pdf", plot = plot1)
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

``` r
#plot 2 with numeric_vector 
plot2<- ggplot(hw2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = numeric_vector)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
#plot 3 with factor_vector 
plot3 <- ggplot(hw2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = factor_vector)) + geom_point()
```

Plot1, which color points using the logical\_vector, and Plot3, which
color points using the factor\_vector, are identical in color scale. The
points in the plot are presented in two colors, which represent true
(green) and false (pink). This makes sense because the logical\_vector
is a logical variable (true/false) and the factor\_vector variable we
created is categorical ordinal, created by coercing the logical
variable. PLot 2, which color points using the numeric variable, has a
range of blue colors - ranging from 0 (darkest blue) to 1 (lightest
blue). This makes sense because the numeric\_vector variable was created
by coercing logical\_vector, and thus, false=0 and true=1.
